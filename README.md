# Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

    The Gaming Room wanted a browser based application that worked on multiple operating systems. They wanted a game that could be run from a server and could       be played with many teams all at the same time. All team names must be unique per game.
    
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    
    I think that I handled the recommendations well, as well as the executive summary.
    
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  
    I thought the executive summary was most helpful. It helped me to really understand and ask myself what I need to do to complete this project.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  
    I would like to revise the Evaluation. I don't know much about a lot of different operating systems, and I feel like I could've left essential stuff out of     my explanations.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    
    I wrote down what the user wanted to make sure I can include it in the final code. You don't want to give the user something they don't want so it is           essential to make something that works well, and it is what the user wants. If you give something that the user dislikes they probably won't be very happy       with it and may even not pay you for it.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    
    I used an agile approach when designing the software. I would probably follow this approach in the future because I think it works really well for               software development. Small steps at a time with a lot of testing is the best way to go if you have a lot of time on your hands for the project.
